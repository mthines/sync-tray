  caveats <<~EOS
    SyncTray provides Google Drive-style automatic folder sync using rclone.
    Works with Dropbox, OneDrive, S3, SFTP, NAS, and 70+ other providers.

    Prerequisites:
      1. Install rclone:  brew install rclone
      2. Configure a remote:  rclone config

    Then launch SyncTray and create a sync profile in Settings.

    Finder "Available Offline" menu:
      Stream (mount) profiles add a right-click "SyncTray > Available Offline" menu
      in Finder. SyncTray reloads Finder for you after an install or upgrade, but if
      the menu doesn't appear, restart Finder manually:

        killall Finder

      On a first install you must also enable the extension once under
      System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions > Extensions.
